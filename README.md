# Exploratory analysis of restaurants rated on Zomato

A exploratory analysis of the restaurants in India is carried out. This is a ongoing analysis and the contents will be vary for  a while. In this [notebook](https://github.com/nathdipankar/restaurants-data-zomato-india/blob/master/Finding%20the%20best%20restuarants.ipynb)you will find an exploratory analysis of the data trying to explore the cuilinary habits of the people rating the restaurants of zomato. Also I will look into the popularity of restaurants depending on the price of the restaurants, cuisines served in the restaurants etc.

I have also used some additional free datasets and maps available in order to complement the Zomato ratings which have been obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data).
